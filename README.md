# PDF Reader with GPT-3

This project is a PDF reader web application that utilizes GPT-3 for generating summaries and answering questions about the uploaded PDF documents.

## Description

The PDF Reader with GPT-3 allows users to upload PDF documents, extract the text content from them, generate summaries, and ask questions about the content. The application uses the PyPDF2 library for extracting text from PDFs and the OpenAI GPT-3 API for generating summaries and answering questions.

## Installation

To run the PDF Reader with GPT-3, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Create a virtual environment for the project:
```
python -m venv myenv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
- For Linux:
  ```
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```
- For Windows:
  ```
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Set up your OpenAI API key:
- Create a file named `config.py` in the same directory as `app.py`.
- In `config.py`, define a variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` and assign your OpenAI API key to it:
  ```python
  OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-goes-here"
  ```

7. Install Node.js if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

8. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `my-app` directory within the project:
```
cd my-app
```

9. Install the required Node.js dependencies:
```
npm install axios
npm install
```

10. Start the my-app server:
 ```
 npm start
 ```

11. In another terminal, go back to the root directory of the project.

12. Start the backend server:
 ```
 python app.py
 ```

13. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application. Or it will open automatically once you have started backend and frontend.

## Usage

1. Upload a PDF file by clicking the "Upload" button. The file will be extracted and stored on the server.

2. Once the upload is complete, you can see the extracted text 
at `http://localhost:5000/text/filename.pdf`.

3. After clicking upload button, enter your question in the "Ask a Question" field and click the "Ask Question" button to get an answer generated by GPT-3.

## Note

Make sure to replace `"your-api-key-goes-here"` in the `config.py` file with your actual OpenAI API key. You can obtain the API key from your OpenAI account.
